# 👋 Hi, I’m @b0id

I’m a systems-oriented developer with a deep interest in **progressive functional computing**, secure architecture, and fullstack scalability.  I am a hard line AMD, Arch Linux, ML tech user.

## 🧠 Interests
- Systems programming, async runtimes, memory models
- Service mesh, microservices, and distributed systems
- AppSec, network security, and secure coding practices

## 🛠️ Currently Working With
- 🦀 Rust, Go, Python, Julia — for systems and runtime infrastructure
- 🟨 NodeJS, Kotlin, Dart/Flutter — for fullstack app dev
- ⚛️ Next.js — for modern web frameworks and front-end orchestration

I’m actively learning and integrating these into **scalable, secure web and service frameworks**.

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration
I'm looking to collaborate on:
- Functional, scalable systems
- LLM tooling, orchestration, or inference runtimes
- Any idea that pushes boundaries in performance or structure
